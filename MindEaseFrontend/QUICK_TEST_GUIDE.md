# Quick Frontend Test Guide

## 🚀 Immediate Testing (No Setup Required!)

Since the React Native environment needs additional setup, I've created a **web-based test version** that you can use immediately to test all frontend functionality.

### How to Test:

1. **Open the web test file:**
   - Navigate to: `MindEaseFrontend/web-test.html`
   - Double-click to open in your web browser
   - Or right-click and select "Open with" → your preferred browser

2. **Make sure your backend is running:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node index.js
   ```

3. **Test all features through the web interface!**

## 🚀 Next Steps

After testing the web version:

1. **If everything works well** → Proceed with React Native setup
2. **If issues found** → Fix them before moving to React Native
3. **For production** → Set up proper React Native environment

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Network error" messages**
   - Make sure backend is running on port 5000
   - Check if `http://localhost:5000` is accessible

2. **CORS errors**
   - Backend should have CORS configured (already done)

3. **Payment errors**
   - Expected with temporary Stripe account
   - Will work with production Stripe setup

### Browser Compatibility:
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile browsers should work for responsive testing

## 🎉 Success!

If all tests pass, your frontend is working correctly and ready for React Native deployment!
