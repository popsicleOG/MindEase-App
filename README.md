# Mental Health App - MindEase

---

## ðŸš¨ Recent Changes & Local Development Notes (June 2025)

- **API Base URL for Local Development:**
  - All frontend and web code now uses `http://localhost:5000` as the API base URL for local development.
  - In `web-test.html`, a line was added at the top of the main script: `const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000';`
  - If you run the frontend on a device/emulator, replace `localhost` with your computer's IP address.

- **Backend Startup:**
  - Always start the backend from the `backend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm run start:robust
    ```
  - Do NOT run backend commands from the project root, or you will get a `package.json` not found error.

- **Frontend/SPA Token Loading:**
  - On refresh, the app checks for a token in storage. If not found, it redirects to login, then back to the last tab.
  - For a smoother experience, consider adding a loading spinner while checking for the token.

- **Troubleshooting:**
  - If you see `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`, ensure the backend is running and accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
  - If you see `API_BASE_URL is not defined`, ensure it is declared at the top of your JS files before use.
